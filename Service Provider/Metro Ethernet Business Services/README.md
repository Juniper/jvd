# Metro Ethernet Business Services â€“ Juniper Validated Design (JVD)

The Metro Ethernet Business Services (Metro EBS) JVD defines a production-ready Cloud Metro architecture composed of a scalable Metro Fabric for access and aggregation, seamlessly integrated with a resilient multi-ring core. This validated design enables x-to-anything connectivity across MEF 3.0-compliant EVPN, VPLS, L2VPN, and L3VPN services. Leveraging Juniper ACX, MX, and PTX Series platforms, the solution supports interdomain color-aware transport, TI-LFA-based resiliency, and intent-based traffic steering for high-performance, future-ready metro deployments.

## ðŸ§± Solution Highlights

- **Metro Fabric + Multi-Ring Core**: Separation of access/aggregation and core domains with seamless interworking
- **Segment Routing (SR-MPLS)** transport with TI-LFA for sub-50ms convergence
- **MEF-compliant service overlays**, including:
  - **EVPN-VPWS**, **EVPN-FXC**, **EVPN-ELAN**, **EVPN-ETREE**
  - **Floating Pseudowires** with Anycast-SID and vESI for active-active L2 resiliency
  - **BGP-VPLS**, **L2VPN**, **L2Circuit**, **L3VPN**, and **EVPN ELAN Type 5**
- **End-to-end resiliency** with active/standby and active/active redundancy
- **Transport Classes** and **BGP Classful Transport (BGP-CT)** for traffic steering
- Validated on platforms including **ACX7024, ACX7100-32C,ACX7100-48L, ACX5448, ACX710, MX204, MX304, PTX10001-36Mr**

## ðŸ“¦ Extended Design: Metro as a Service (MaaS)

This solution is extended by the [Metro as a Service (MaaS) JVD](https://www.juniper.net/documentation/us/en/software/jvd/jvd-metro-ebs-mef-03-02/index.html), which builds upon Metro EBS by introducing a richer services portfolio and full end-to-end MEF 3.0 conformance over a Cloud Metro architecture.
