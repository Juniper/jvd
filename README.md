Juniper Validated Design (JVD) is a cross-functional collaboration between Juniper Solution Architects and Test teams to develop coherent multidimensional solutions for domain-specific use cases. The JVD team comprises technical leaders in the industry with a wealth of experience supporting complex customer use cases.
Using JVD, customers can significantly reduce the risk of costly mistakes while saving time and money in the deployment of network solutions. JVD provides benefits such as a more stable network with fewer bugs and a shorter time to resolution if any bugs are discovered. The validation process ensures that the network is optimized for maximum performance, leading to a better user experience for enterprise/SP operation and network service consumers. Furthermore, the design concepts deployed are formulated around best practices, leveraging relevant technologies to deliver the scope of the solution. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are identified as part of an extensive test plan that focuses on functionality, performance integrity, and service delivery. With JVDs, customers can shorten the time to market when implementing new network solutions, reducing the lead time to generate revenue from new services.
