**3-stage EVPN-VXLAN Data Center Design**

The 3-Stage Data Center Design is the most common Juniper data center network architecture and offers
comprehensive guidance on deploying a modern 3-stage data center fabric with EVPN-VXLAN. As with all Juniper data center JVDs, this solution follows best practices as determined by
Juniperâ€™s subject matter experts, including Juniper support teams. This JVD is the result of extensive consultation and testing to find the
balance between capability, performance, and cost efficiency to meet the needs of scalable data center deployments.

The 3-stage Datacenter design is based on the ERB design with lean spine. The border leaf switches were validated against different Juniper device models. For more information on this design refer the JVD link below:

The configurations uploaded here are validated configurations.
