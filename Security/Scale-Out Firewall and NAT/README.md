## üìò Juniper Validated Designs (JVDs)

Solution architectures are documented in multiple Juniper Validated Design documents:

## üì¶ CSDS ScaleOut JVD Scenarios

A common general view for all CSDS ScaleOut scenarios:

> MX Series routers act as stateless load balancers for SRX-based stateful security services.

## üß© Common Technical Architectures

These JVDs are all based on the same ScaleOut technical architecture, which has four deployment options:

![CSDS ScaleOut architectures](images/ScaleOut-COMMON-architectures.png)

- Single MX with multiple standalone SRX/vSRX
- Dual MX (using SRD) with multiple pairs of SRX/vSRX (MNHA)
- Single MX with multiple pairs of SRX/vSRX (MNHA)
- Dual MX with multiple pairs of SRX/vSRX (MNHA)

> Why four options?  
Some designs favor lightweight deployments with minimal redundancy. Others require added resiliency (via MNHA or SRD), or both ("belt and suspenders").

## üîÅ Traffic Load Balancing

Two methods are supported, each with shared fundamentals:

- **ECMP CHASH**  
  Load balances traffic across SRX devices using ECMP and consistent hashing. Relies on BGP and BFD to maintain path liveness.

- **TLB / TO**  
  Uses ECMP CHASH underneath, but adds service-level grouping and health checks to maintain per-service availability and load distribution.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Notes

This folder contains configurations for the **TLB-based architecture** for Stateful Firewall and CGNAT services using both IPv4 and IPv6.

Other config examples for **ECMP CHASH** and **TLB** variants are included in the respective JVD documents.
